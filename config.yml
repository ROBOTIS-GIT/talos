# System Manager Configuration
# This file defines the containers that the system_manager can control.
#
# Services are discovered dynamically from each agent - no need to list them here.
# The agent (running in each container) is the source of truth for available services.
#
# Optional: You can add service labels for better display names in the UI.
# If a service is not listed here, its ID will be used as the label.
