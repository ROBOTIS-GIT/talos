# System Manager Configuration
# This file defines the containers that the system_manager can control.
#
# Services are discovered dynamically from each agent - no need to list them here.
# The agent (running in each container) is the source of truth for available services.
#
# Optional: You can add service labels for better display names in the UI.
# If a service is not listed here, its ID will be used as the label.

containers:
  ai_worker:
    socket_path: "/agents/ai_worker/s6_agent.sock"
    # Optional: Service labels for better display names
    # Services are automatically discovered from the agent at /run/service
    # services:
    #   - id: "ffw_bg2_follower_ai"
    #     label: "FFW BG2 Follower AI"
